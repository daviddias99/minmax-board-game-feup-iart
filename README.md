**Description:** To implement concepts of classical Artificial Intelligence we implemented a board game (Eximo) that can be played against a computer. The computer implements a Minimax algorithm with configurable depth, use of Alpha-Beta pruning and move ordering.

**Technologies:** Python, Pygame

**Skills:** Minimax, Alpha-beta pruning, Move ordering, Heuristics, Board game, Artificial intelligence

**Grade:** 19.5/20
